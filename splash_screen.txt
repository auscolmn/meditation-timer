Summary of the "Zen Spacing" Logic

The most important "instruction" for your coding agent is to avoid vertical centering. In a zen layout, items should feel like they are floating in an intentional hierarchy from top to bottom, with at least 25% of the total screen height left as empty space at any given point.
